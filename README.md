Runtime non-null assertions with Eclipse
========================================

This is a small compile participant that inserts runtime non-null checks for parameters and methods that are annotated with
@NonNull annotations.

This feature was inspired by the equivalent [functionality](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/annotation_java.html) in IntelliJ IDEA, where the "compiler can be configured to track @NotNull annotation compliance during the application runtime."
